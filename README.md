# Basic_PIDcontroller_ApplicationOnAnalogData
 Just a basic application and visualization of PID controller using Arduino.
 The tools used are:
 1. Arduino Atmega
 2. LED
 3. LDR sensor (to detect light)
 4. PID controller and observer
 
 Function:
 The LDR sensor will detect the intensity of light emitted by LED to ensure the LED is emitting the correct amount of light intensity as per programmed by the code.
 Errors will surely bound to happen thus a PID controller is applied to the system.
